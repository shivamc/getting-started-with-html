  <html></html><h1>Introduction to the Basics of HTML</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Ingrediants of the Internet</b><br>
1. <em>HTML</em> which stands for Hyper Text Markup Languages
<br>
2. Major Parts of the Web are Browser, Net, Server and HTTP which is a protocol.
<br>
3. <em>HTML</em> can include Text, Markups, Media and Links to other pages.
</p>

<p><b>HTML Markup</b> <em>Tags</em>
  <br>
  Note- All tags except void tags have an opening and closing,<br> now we shall talk about various tags.
  <br>
  1. The <b>BOLD</b> tag makes the content of the text font bold.
  <br>
  2. The <em>Emphasis</em> tag makes the content of the text font Italics.
  <br>
  3. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor">Anchor</a> Tab is according to me one of the most important tags, as it is instrumenal<br>in giving meaning to the word <b>Web</b>.
  <br>
  4. The <b>Image</b> Tag is also a very important tags, example of it mentioned here <img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/2/000/0ba/3fb/1af8ca8.jpg" alt="too famous to feature here"><br>
  <b>OMG they know who I am Now!!</b>
  <br>
  On a serious note Image tags are also an example of Void tags like Break Tab.
  <br>
  5. The White Space tags like the break tag and p tags are used to give whites spaces between <br>lines and paras.

</p>

<p><b>Span and Div Tags</b>
  <br>
  To be honest i did not understand Span and Div tags a lot, i only understood that the main <br>difference between the two is that Span is Inline and Div is Block.
  <br>
   <span> Spamis Inline hence non space i think ? </span>
  <div>Giving an Example of Div now as white space is good.</div> 
</p>
<br>
<em>This is what i have understood till now, I am very excited as i know this is basic stuff but its still<br>very interesting and useful.</em>
